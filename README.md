# tunnel-risk-surrogate-models
Tunnel Stability Surrogate Model Trainer - Trains ANN, XGBoost, and SVR models to predict tunnel displacements, safety factors, and risk probabilities from geotechnical parameters. Includes classification analysis and Monte Carlo simulations for collapse probability assessment.
(it's in the ohter branch) (main-code)
