# tunnel-risk-surrogate-models
Tunnel Stability Surrogate Model Trainer - Trains ANN, XGBoost, and SVR models to predict tunnel displacements, safety factors, and risk probabilities from geotechnical parameters. Includes classification analysis and Monte Carlo simulations for collapse probability assessment.
(main code --> code) it should be 387 lines.

This is a prototype framework for comparing ML methods in a geotechnical context. The data is pure random linear combination with noise

DISCLAIMER: This code uses synthetic data with simplified physics.
