# tunnel-risk-surrogate-models
Tunnel Stability Surrogate Model Trainer - Trains ANN, XGBoost, and SVR models to predict tunnel displacements, safety factors, and risk probabilities from geotechnical parameters. Includes classification analysis and Monte Carlo simulations for collapse probability assessment.

DISCLAIMER: This code uses synthetic data with simplified physics.
It is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. if you need an actual model ask an engineer. I'm an undergrad

(it's in the ohter branch) (main-code)


my first project!

open for advice
